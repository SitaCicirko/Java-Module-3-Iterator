# Java-Module-3-Iterator
Write a program that will have:

variable int sumA (initialized with the value 1000),
variable int sumB (initialized with the value 0),
while loop inside which:
we randomly select an int number from the range 0-9 and add it to the variable sumA,
we randomly select an int from 0-49 and add it to sumB.
Loop as long as sumA > sumB is true.

In each iteration, display the number of the loop run and the current values of both variables.
